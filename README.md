If you wanted to drive from SF to NYC, spending as little time as possible in republican-voting counties, what route should you take?

The county voting data is taken from the NYT election map (pulled through dev tools) and the adjacency data is from [NBER](https://www.nber.org/research/data/county-adjacency). There were some irregularities which I ignored.
